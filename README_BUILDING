Build Instructions:

This version of XCC is known to build with GCC 3.4. Tensilica does not
provide GCC, but it should be easily available from the Free Software
Foundation (FSF). These instructions assume that the correct version of
GCC is the first one found in your path.

To build XCC:

1. Obtain both the XCC source files (xcc-src.tar.gz) and the Xtensa GNU
tool sources (gnu-tool-src.tar.gz).

2. Create a new directory to hold the source files.  This directory is
   referred to here as $srcdir.

3. Untar the GNU tool sources into $srcdir.

4. Untar the XCC sources in the same location.

5. Tell the build scripts where to find the build tool bison, also
   available from the FSF.  Set the STDTOOLS environment variable to
   the "prefix" directory where bison is installed.  (This is the
   directory one level above the "bin" directory containing bison,
   typically "/usr" or "/usr/local".)  For example, if you have
   /usr/bin/bison, you would set STDTOOLS to /usr.

6. Create a new build directory, separate from the source files.  This
   will be referred to here as $builddir.  Inside $builddir, create
   each of the following directories:

   libisa
   xtparams
   libcommon
   libtie
   libauto
   config-info
   binutils
   xcc

7. Run the configure scripts: go to each build directory and run the
   configure script from the corresponding source directory.  Set the
   --target option to xtensa-elf and use the --prefix option to
   specify the directory where you want to install XCC.  For example,
   if you want to install to a directory called $installdir, the
   Bourne shell syntax for this would be:

   cd $builddir
   for d in *; do
     (cd $d && $srcdir/$d/configure --target=xtensa-elf --prefix=$installdir)
   done

8. Run make in each build directory.  Because there are dependencies
   between build directories, you must do this in the order the
   directories are listed in step (6).  For each directory except
   binutils, run "make" followed by "make install".  For binutils,
   you only need to build the linker, so use "make all-ld install-ld"
   in that directory.
