# Common makefile rules.
#
# Notes:
#	- After including $(ROOT)/usr/include/make/commondefs, a makefile may
#	  say ``include $(COMMONRULES)'' to get this file.
#	- It is up to the including makefile to define a default rule before
#	  including $(COMMONRULES).
#	- The parent makefile must define TARGETS in order for clobber to work.
#
#	- if BUILD_SUBDIRS is set, then iterate over that for the COMMONTARGS

#
# An always-unsatisfied target.  The name is unlikely to occur in a file tree,
# but if _force existed in a make's current directory, this target would be
# always-satisfied and targets that depended on it would not be made.
#
$(_FORCE):

#
# File removal rules: there are three.
#	- clean removes dirt
#	- clobber removes targets, dirt, and Makedepend
#	- rmtargets removes targets only
# One might 'make clean' in a large tree to reclaim disk space after targets
# are built, but before they are archived into distribution images on disk.
# One might 'make rmtargets' to remove badly-linked executables, and then
# run a 'make' to re-link the good objects.
